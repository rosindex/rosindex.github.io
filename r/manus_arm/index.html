================================================================================

I. Introduction

The ROS stack manus_arm allows a Manus ARM to be controlled by activity from a
spiking neural network. Dish simulation and pre-recorded playback is currently
supported, with a live link connection planned.

If you are only interested in code to control the Manus ARM, that can be found
in the "arm" package.

================================================================================

II. System requirements

To run anything, the system must have ROS installed and configured. For anything
more than recording voltage distributions, the system must have a Manus ARM
connected and configured properly. To use the Brian simulator nodes, the system
must have Python and Brian installed.

================================================================================

III. Running the stack

There are several launch files located in the arm node:

    1. csv.launch:

        Uses CSV playback to control the ARM. All parameters are loaded from
        csv.yaml in the launch folder.

    2. brian_csv.launch

        Uses CSV playback recorded from a Brian simulation to control the ARM.
        All parameters are loaded from brian_csv.yaml in the launch folder.

    3. brian_sim.launch

        Uses the Brian simulator to control the ARM. All parameters are loaded
        from brian_sim.yaml in the launch folder.

    4. volt_only_csv.launch

        Creates and records voltage distributions from a CSV file, skipping ARM
        movement. All parameters are loaded from volt_only_csv.launch in the
        launch folder.

    5. volt_only_brian_csv.launch

        Creates and records voltage distributions from a CSV file from a Brian
        simulation, skipping ARM movement. All parameters are loaded from 
        volt_only_brian_csv.launch in the launch folder.

    6. volt_only_brian_sim.launch

        Creates and records voltage distributions from the Brian simulator,
        skipping ARM movement. All parameters are loaded from 
        volt_only_brian_sim.launch in the launch folder.

================================================================================

IV. Parameters

The following parameters are used by the arm_project stack. Not all parameters
are used by every launch configuration. If a parameter is missing, some will 
have default values, but others will cause the node to fail.

    do_volt_distr (bool)
        Whether or not to record voltage distributions. Default is Yes.

    do_burst_calc (bool)
        Whether or not to run burst calculation, which results in ARM movement.
        Default is Yes.

    arm_speed (int)
        Relative speed of all of the ARM's joints. Can be 0 to 4. Default is 2. 

    arm_safe_range (float)
        Safe maxiumum range of the ARM's X/Y motion in any direction from the
        start position, in 0.022mm units. Default is 20000.0.

    max_range_from_midpoint (float)
        Maximum range of how far a CAs value will move on an X/Y grid from the
        midpoint (4.5/4.5). See arm/src/teleop_arm_dish.cpp for more info. 
        Default is 1.0.

    loop_rate (int)
        How many times per second a dish_state is published. A value too large/
        too fast may cause segfaults and other horrible things. Default is 200.

    buffer_size (int)
        How many dish states will be used to calculate baseline and threshold.
        Default is 1000.

    stdev_mult (float)
        Multiplier of standard deviation to calculate spike threshold. A value
        too large may result in no spikes being detected. Default is 3.0.

    burst_window (int)
        The window size of dish states when checking for bursts. Default is 
        1000.

    volt_distr_log_path (string)
        File path of the voltage distribution CSV log. Leaving this blank will
        result in the log not being saved. No default.

    volt_distr_img_path (string)
        File path of the voltage distribution image. Leaving this blank will
        result in the image not being saved. No default.

    do_truncate_volts (bool)
        Whether or not to truncate volts to 4 digits after the decimal. Useful 
        for Brian simulations where unmodified voltages will result in thousands 
        of unique values with a frequency of 1. Default is No.

    cat_log_path (string)
        The path of the CSV file which will log all of this session's CATs and 
        bursts. Leaving this blank will result in the log not being saved. No
        default.

    csv_file_path (string)
        The path of the CSV file containing recorded dish state activity. Only
        required if you are using the CSV receiver node. Leaving this blank will 
        result in the node failing. No default.

    csv_skip_lines (int)
        Number of lines to skip in the CSV file to account for headers and junk
        data. Default is 1.

    brian_connections_file_path (string)
        The path of the Brian connections pickle file. This file is generated
        by running SeedMea.py. Only required if you are using the Brian receiver
        node. Leaving this blank will result in the node failing. No default.

    brian_pad_neuron_map_file_path (string)
        The path of the Brian pad neuron map pickle file. This file is
        generated by running SeedMea.py. Only required if you are using the
        Brian receiver node. Leaving this blank will result in the node failing. 
        No default.

    brian_running_time (float)
        How long to run the Brian simulation, in seconds. Only required if you 
        are using the Brian receiver node. Note that high values will have you
        waiting forever as it takes longer than what is specified to actually
        run the simulation. Default is 30.0.

================================================================================

VI. Package: arm

This package controls the ARM and creates movement commands.

    A. Node: arm_control

    The interface to the ARM. Movement commands are sent to this node from the
    teleop nodes. Movement is interruptible; a new command will override 
    any current movement in progress.

    B. Node: teleop_arm_dish

    This node receives cat messages and uses that information to generate
    cartesian_move messages. Those messages are then sent to arm_control.

    C. Node: teleop_arm_key

    This node generates constant_move messages from keyboard input. This node
    cannot be launched from a launch file; it must be run manually in its own
    terminal window. Most keys have a toggle functionality: press to start
    movement and press again to stop movement. A list of all of the keyboard
    commands can be found in include/arm/key_codes.h.

    D. Message: cartesian_move

    A cartesian move command will move the ARM to a certain position and then 
    stop. The cartesian_move message contains an array of 7 floats representing
    positions of each ARM joint, and an integer representing movement speed. The
    file include/arm/movement_definitions.h defines each index in the array.
    Units are in increments of 0.022mm. More information about position units
    can be found in include/arm/ManusArm.cpp. Movement speed can be 5 values
    ranging from 0 to 4.

    E: Message: cartesian_moves

    This message contains a vector of cartesian_move messages, allowing an
    entire sequence of cartesian_moves to be published at once. It also has
    a starting timestamp in its header, and an ending timestamp allowing for
    timed movement sequences.

    F. Message: constant_move

    A constant move command will move all of the ARM joints in specified
    directions constantly until a new command is issued. The constant_move
    message contains an array of 9 integers representing movement states of each
    ARM joint, the lift unit, and movement speed. The file 
    include/arm/movement_definitions.h defines each index in the array. All
    values except for movement speed can either be 1 (positive movement), 0 (no
    movement), or -1 (negative movement). Movement speed can be 5 values ranging
    from 0 to 4.

    G. Message: contant_move_time

    This message contains a constant move, a starting timestamp in its header,
    and an ending timestamp. This allows for timed constant moves.

================================================================================

VII. Package: burst_calc

This package is where the magic happens. All the dish states generated from a 
receiver node are sent here for spike and burst detection. 

    A. Node: burst_creator

    This node creates burst sequence messages and publishes them to the
    cat_creator node. It also seeds the dish_viz node and tells it when to
    start running.

    B. Node: cat_creator

    This node generates CAT (center of activity trajectory) messages from burst
    sequences that it receives, and sends those messages to the teleop_arm_dish
    node.

    C. Message: burst

    This message contains a vector of ints containing the indexes of each
    channel bursting in the sequence, and a vector of all the dish_states in the 
    sequence. The header has a timestamp marking the beginning of the sequence,
    and there is a time object marking the end of the sequence.

    D. Message: ca

    This message has two floats containing the X and Y values of a CA (center of
    activity). The timestamp in the header is the same time as the dish state
    that the CA was derived from.

    E. Message: cat

    This message is very similar to the burst message. It contains a vector of 
    all the CA messages in the CAT. The timestamp in the header, the end time 
    object, and the vector of ints are all the same as the burst message that 
    the CAT was derived from. 

    F. Message: ranges

    This message is used to seed the dish_viz node. It has three arrays of 60
    floats each: one for the baseline voltages of each channel, one for the
    minimum voltages of each channel, and one for the maximum voltages of each
    channel.

================================================================================

VIII. Package: dish_viz

This package provides a visual representation of dish states.

    A. Node: dish_viz

    This node provides a visual representation of dish states. It starts
    automatically after the first burst is created in the burst_creator node. It
    runs in sync with the movement of the ARM to visualize the dish activity 
    that is causing movement. Red circles indicate below-threshold activity,
    while blue circles show spikes.

================================================================================

IX. Package: neuro_recv

This package is responsible for generating dish states from various sources.

    A. Node: csv_recv

    This node generates and publishes dish states from a CSV file.

    B. Node: brian_recv.py

    This node generates and publishes dish states from a Brian simulation.

    C. Node: brian_to_csv.py

    This node generates dish states and writes them to a CSV file for use later.
    It is meant to be run alone, and not with any other nodes or as part of a
    launch file.

    D. Node: SeedMea.py

    This node generates the connections and
    pad neuron map pickle files used by the brian_recv.py and brian_to_csv 
    nodes. It is meant to be run alone, and not with any other nodes or as part
    of a launch file.

    E. Message: dish_state

    The dish_state message contains an array of 60 floats representing the 
    voltage of each channel in the dish at a certain point in time. The header
    of the message contains a timestamp that represents when the dish state
    occurred relative to the beginning of playback.

================================================================================

X. Package: time_server

This package helps keep nodes in sync by providing a global clock and a time
request service.

    A. Node: time_server

    This node contains a clock which starts at zero and is initialized 
    immediately after the burst_creator node has finished buffering. The time
    request service time_srv allows other nodes to request the clock time so 
    that they can stay in sync.

    B. Service: time_srv

    The request of this service is a time object that the requesting node wants
    to compare to the time_server time. The response is a time object containing
    time_server time and a duration object containing the difference between
    time_server time and the requested time.

================================================================================

XI. Package: volt_distr

This package records voltage distributions for each channel.

    A. Node: volt_distr

    This node receives a copy of every non-buffer dish state from the receiver
    node and creates voltage distributions for each channel. After the last dish
    has been published, a CSV log of the distributions is saved. In addition,
    an SVG image showing a color-coded grid of all of the channels is created 
    and saved. A blue channel indicates a majority of positive voltages, and
    red indicates a majority of negative voltages.
